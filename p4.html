        Reflection

      <p>
        Sometimes when I want to eat a banana, I buy it and often forget to eat it. Day after day passes like that, and at some point when I smelled a banana and looked at it, I could find a lot of brown spots on it. Then, I finally feel that a lot of time has passed and eat the bananas before they ripen more. So, based on my personal experience and memory, I realized that I can read time through a banana, and the banana tells me how much time has passed by its color and pattern.Â 
        
        In the design process, it was really difficult and complicated to make it change its appearance over time. From making the banana shape looks three-dimensional to making the brown spots appear, everything was difficult and took a lot of time, but using conditional statement and time, I was able to further develop my design and I learned how to set the starting and restarting point which helped me to solve the problems I had in the previous assignment. 
        
        Overall, it was really fun to design an unconventional clock that reminds me of my own memories and tells the story of my experience.
