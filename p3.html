      <p>
        During the design process, I first sketched the first and last steps of the face on paper, and made the steps in between using the coding language in p5.js.

It was easy to draw a face using basic shapes, but after that, it didnâ€™t easily go in the direction I wanted. My initial intention was to make the middle part of the face stretch upward only, but it was difficult to find a way to make it grow only to a certain range. Also, I wanted the ears to move along the movement line of the face, but this was also really difficult. In this way, I faced many obstacles until I came up with a design I was satisfied with.

My favorite part is that I use "mousePressed" and "keyPressed" to make the mouth grow longer and longer when clicked, and to make the hair appear and disappear when I press the left and right arrow keys on the keyboard. 

Through this assignment , I discovered that I could create artwork that users could interact with my designs.
